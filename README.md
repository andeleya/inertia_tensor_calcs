# inertia_tensor_calcs
This notebook calcualtes the Principal Moments of Inertia and their direction cosines for rigid bodies given their mass and and 
products of inertia in the orthogonal axes x, y, and z. This was given as a solution to a Moodle quiz in the course Rigid-Body 
Dynamics (units would typically be Kg.m^2). Because of duality, the same calculations would apply to the calculation of Principal 
Stresses in Mechanics of Materials (with typical units of N/m^2).
